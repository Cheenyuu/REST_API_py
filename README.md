# REST API Implementation in Python

Just a general implementation to learn how to troubleshoot and build communication between a server and a client manually in Python.

## Purpose

My understanding of how a REST API works is incredibly limited (teetering on no knowledge at all right now) and I want to learn so this github repo will have a few things that I'm focusing on...

1. `Understanding`
    - Within the repo I will be including all of the notes I take in regards to REST API's, how they work, their primary function, how the individual functions work, etc.
    - The notes will be as comprehensive as I can make them, hopefully if anyone stumbles upon my project and would like to learn REST API's themselves, this repo will be a good place for them to get a full understanding all in one place.

2. `Implementation`
    - After understanding exactly what I'm working on and the design of it, I will be attempting to implement it myself using tutorials and help online in order to make sure I have a functioning and working program that is able to perform its primary function.

3. `Expansion`
    - I don't think it would be right to call a piece of code "mine" if I just lift it from someone else's tutorial so I will be attempting to include my own functions, implementations or possible improvements. Expanding on how the code works and what I will be adding will be explicitly documented. If there are any kind of performance improvements or even failures, they will be documented as well in a developer log I will include in this repo.
